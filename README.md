# emmas_wordcloud

My wife, Emma asked me to make a word cloud for her class in school, so I just
put this one together for her.

I used lorem ipsum to generate random words, as she didn't want to have her pupil names to be public.

I used following libraries for this quick project:

* tidytext
* dplyr
* wordcloud2
* text2vec

I also experimented with "wordcloud" library, but I discarded it as it was a bit boring.

Next I'd like to make a shiny app that would generate wordclouds.
